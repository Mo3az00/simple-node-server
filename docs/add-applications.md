# Adding applications

Now that your server is fully configured and all services are running as expected, it's time to add your websites and web applications, so that you can run any project on your machine. Keep in mind that the machine is a low powered Droplet, that you need to upgrade, if you want to run multiple applications that get more traffic from users.

We will not talk about Continuous Integration in this tutorial, as it would go beyond the scope. This means that you have to update your code manually, after you push changes to Github.

## Different types of applications

As the setup is slightly different for the most common types of application that you will run on your server, there are 3 separate guides below, which share only some parts of the setup process.

1. [HTML, CSS & JavaScript](./add-applications-html-css-js.md)
1. [Node.js & MongoDb](./add-applications-nodejs-mongodb.md)
1. [React](./add-application-react.md)

## That's it!

Once you've added your application, that's everything you needed to do.
